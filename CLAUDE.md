# SecPipeAI Research Project

You are assisting in building a reproducible ML-based intrusion detection research pipeline.

Hard Constraints:
- Do NOT fabricate results.
- Use only publicly available datasets.
- All metrics must come from executed code.
- CPU-only compatibility (8GB RAM system).
- Reproducibility required (Makefile + pinned dependencies).

Coding Standards:
- Python 3.10+
- scikit-learn + XGBoost (CPU mode only)
- All outputs saved under outputs/
- Raw data must never be modified
- Scripts runnable via Makefile targets
